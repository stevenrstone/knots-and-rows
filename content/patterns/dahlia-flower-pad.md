# Dahlia Flower Pad Tutorial

One of my favorite details when hosting friends for a meal is the doily. Sure, we can go out and buy the disposable paper doilies we used when we were in grade school to decorate Valentine's Day cards. Or we can be super daring and crochet then block some cotton thread doilies.

Eh, I'd like to go medium daring and create a dahlia flower. Depending on the yarn you use, this can be a thick doily, a hot pad, or a centerpiece base.

When I first looked at this, I won't lie - I thought it was daunting to say the least. Then I remembered that, like almost all crochet patterns, it is just a new combination of the same stitches I've been doing for years. Let's get started!

I will do a photo tutorial first with a condensed pattern at the bottom.

## Notions:

- ~130 yards of yarn
  - I used Cascade North Shore in Teal
- Size H 5.00mm hook

## Abbreviations Used (US):

- sl st - slip stitch - Insert your hook, yarn over, and pull the loop back through the stitch and the loop on your hook.
- sc - single crochet - Insert your hook, yarn over, and pull the loop back through the stitch. Yarn over once more and pull through both loops currently on your hook.
- hdc - half double crochet - Yarn over, insert your hook, yarn over again, and pull through the stitch. Yarn over once more and pull through all three loops currently on your hook.
- dc - double crochet - Yarn over, insert your hook, yarn over again, and pull through the stitch. Yarn over once more and pull through first two loops currently on your hook. Yarn over a last time and pull through last two loops on your hook.

## Special Stitches:

- Petal - 1 sc in first stitch, 1 hdc in second stitch, 5 dc in third stitch, 1 hdc in fourth stitch, 1 sc in fifth stitch.

## Photo Tutorial:

To start out, make a magic circle (or ch 6 and sl st the ends to create a circle).

![](/dahlia-3.jpg)

Round One: Ch 1, work 15 sc into ring and join with sl st in first sc.

![](/dahlia-4.jpg)

Round Two: Ch 2 (counts as 1dc), work 2dc in every sc around. Join with sl st at top of initial ch 2 of the round.

Round Three [Petal Round]: In this round, and all future Petal Rounds, only work in the front loops. Ch 1, sc in same stitch, hdc in next stitch, 5 dc, 1 hdc, 1sc. You have created one petal!

Continue the petal around - (sc, hdc, 5dc, hdc, sc). You should end up with six complete petals at the end of the round. Sl st in the first ch of this round.

Round Four [Support Round]: If you look at the underside of the round you just completed you should look like the picture below.

![](/dahlia-8.jpg)

You will work Support Rounds on the same stitches as the Petal Rounds, but in the back loops. Hold the work normally as you were before and work in behind the petals. Ch 2 and work 1 dc in the same stitch. Continue 1 dc, 2 dc around, ending with a sl st in the top of the initial ch 2 of this round.

Round Five [Petal Round]: Exactly as Round Three, work petal stitches in the front loops of the dcs you made in Round Four, finishing with a sl st in the top of the ch you made at the beginning of the round.

Round Six [Support Round]: Exactly as Round Four, work only in the back loops in the same stitches where the petals took the front loops. On this round, however, only work one dc in each stitch around.

Continue switching between a Petal Round and a Support Round until you have reached your optimal size. If you are wanting to change colors, do so when starting a Support Round if you want the two colors to be in line. If you would like a somewhat ombre effect, change colors when starting a Petal Round.

Important Note: The first Support Round is an increasing round where you increase the number of stitches in your project. The Support Rounds go as follows:\
Round Four: _dc, dc 2_ around - Support Increase Round\
Round Six: dc 1 around - Support Round\
Round Eight: _dc, dc, dc 2_ around - Support Increase Round\
Round Ten: dc 1 around - Support Round\
Round Twelve: _dc, dc, dc, dc 2_ around - Support Increase Round

## Written Pattern:

Make Magic Circle OR ch 6 and connect to create a ring.

Round One: sc 15 into ring

Round Two: 2 dc in each sc around

Round Three [Petal Round]: Front Loops Only - ch 2, sc in same st, hdc, 5 dc, hdc, sc. Petal created. Continue petal stitch (sc, hdc, 5 dc, hdc, sc) around, ending round with 6 complete petals. Sl st to top of initial ch 2 of round.

Round Four [Support Increase Round]: Back Loops Only - Working in same stitches as previous round, ch 2, dc in same stitch, _dc, 2 dc_ around until end, sl st in top of initial ch 2 of this round.

Round Five [Petal Round]: Front Loops Only - ch 2, sc in same stitch, hdc, 5 dc, sc. Petal created. Continue petal stitch around, ending with 9 complete petals. Sl st to top of initial ch 2 of round.

Round Six [Support Round]: Back Loops Only - Working in same stitches as previous round, ch 2, dc around, sl st in top of initial ch 2 of this round.

Round Seven [Petal Round]: Front Loops Only - ch 2 and work the same initial petal sequence and petal stitch around. Sl st to top of initial ch 2 of round. You should have 9 petals again at the end of this round.

Repeat the pattern as such until desired length is reached:

[Petal Round] - front loops only\
[Support Increase Round] - back loops only\
[Petal Round] - front loops only\
[Support Round] - back loops only.

I hope you enjoy and please share the photos of your completed projects!
