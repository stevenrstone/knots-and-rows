# Every Soldier Of Love Needs Coffee

Or tea, or, for those daring ones, some Irish coffee.

Whatever you put in your coffee cup, this pattern is for a sailor scout like you.

![How do you expect me to fight when I don't have caffeine?](/soldier-of-love-1.jpg "How do you expect me to fight when I don't have caffeine?")

## My supplies:

- Cotton yarn in worsted weight– in white and the coordinating colors of your sailor scout of choice
- H/5mm crochet hook
- Tapestry needle
- Scissors

This project can be done in any most any type of yarn, though I’d stay away from super silky ones because dropping it and having zero grip on your cup would end in a not so happy day. While I used cotton (because I have a love affair with soft cotton yarn), acrylic and wool are perfectly fine to use along with a plethora of other fibers. If you can find the colors of your favorite scout or even your original creation, then have at it!

Also, please be sure test your gauge after one or two rounds on the cup you plan on using this on, just so you can make sure it doesn’t slide too easily off and on. Adjust your hook as necessary.

## Mug Holder:

This pattern starts at the bottom of the holder and works up.  
With white yarn  
Ch 30  
SS to beginning ch to form ring. Be careful not to twist.

This is a good time to wrap it around the bottom of where you think the bottom of your holder will be on your cup of choice.  
R1: Ch 1, sc in same ch you ss into, and sc around. ss to top of ch1 at beginning of round.  
R2: Ch1, sc in same st, sc in next 15 sts, 2sc in next st, sc to end of round, ss to top of ch1  
R3: Ch 1, sc in same st, and sc around. ss to top of ch1  
R4: Ch1, sc in same st, sc in next 16 sts, 2sc in next st (should line up closely with the 2in1sc from R2), sc to end of round, ss to top of ch1  
R5: Ch 1, sc in same st, and sc around. ss to top of ch1  
R6-9: Ch1, do not sc in same stitch, sc around and join with ss to starting ch  
Cut yarn and pull through

For me, this measured about 2.5 inches/6.2 cm tall. As long as it is a height that you like, then you can stop. Again, the important part is the circumference and that it fits snugly, but not chokingly, on your cup.

## Brooch:

With first color yarn (red on mine)

Create a magic circle and sc 7 into it.  
Ss to first sc and cinch tight.  
Cut yarn and pull through

## Collar (make two):

Ch 7  
R1: Ch1, turn, sc2 together, sc 1, sc 2 together  
R2: Ch 1, turn, sk 1 st, sc 2  
Cut yarn and pull through

## Top Bow:

With second color yarn (purple on mine)

Ch 13  
R1: Hdc in third chain from hook, hdc 3 , sc 2, hdc 5  
R2: Ch 2, turn, hdc 4, sc 3, hdc 4  
R3: Ch 2, turn, hdc 4, sc 3, hdc 4  
R4: Ch 1, turn, hdc 2, ss 4, hdc 2  
Cut yarn and pull through

Also cut off a length of yarn (I used about 24 inches) of second color and wrap it around the center of this piece to cinch it tighter. See picture below for how it should look once finished.

## Bottom Bow (make two):

With second color yarn (purple on mine)

Ch 6  
R1: sc in second ch from hook, hdc 3, sc 4 in last chain, (now working in other side of chain and bottom of original sts) hdc 3, sc to first ch  
Cut yarn and pull through

Here are all of your pieces without the ends woven in

And here they are oven in - feel free to use the thread to pull and slightly perfect the shapes of your appliques.

Now you have made all of the pieces! Time to assemble...  
How you do this is up to you.  
Some prefer fabric or hot glue.  
Others prefer to sew with needle and thread or yarn and a tapestry needle.  
Whatever your fancy, arrange the pieces to look like your sailor soldier's schmancy top in your ideal fashion and use your tools to make the magic happen. I will totally not judge you if you pretend your hot glue gun is a crescent wand. Because then I'd be a hypocrite.

Go make your drink of choice, slip on your new cozy, and go fight for love and justice!
