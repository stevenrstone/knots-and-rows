# Frequently Asked Questions

### What dyes do you use?

I use acid dyes and ensure they completely are exhausted and washed for maximum color retention.

### How do I wash your yarn?

All of my bases (so far) are superwash wool so you can wash them machine cold on the gentle cycle. It is always suggested you lay flat to dry.

### Can you cake my yarn?

Yes! But you have to notify me. Please email (listed below) me listing your order number and let me know how many skeins you need caked.

### When will my yarn ship?

All yarns are dyed to order and will ship out as soon as I can and no later than one week from your order date. The only exception to this are larger orders (above 10 skeins) or if I am on the very rare vacation. In the event of the latter, I will put up a notice on the shop.
